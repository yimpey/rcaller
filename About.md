# Introduction #

RCaller is a LGPL'ed library for calling R from Java. It is easy to use, practical and handy tool. It is in-efficient by means of CPU time, memory efficiency and some other issues.

Please visit the RCaller samples, discussions on some pages of http://stdioe.blogspot.com

Project was mainly started in http://www.mhsatman.com but I am no longer using that site for news about the RCaller.

Project is officially hosted by the Google Code.
